# CongestionControl

CongestionControl is a project for implementing and testing various congestion control algorithms.  
All documentation and comments in this project will be written in English, and all algorithm implementations will use the C++ programming language.  
I will develop and organize multiple congestion control algorithms in this repository for the purposes of learning, comparison, and experimentation.
